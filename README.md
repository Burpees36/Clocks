# Clocks
## What is the purpose of this program?
This is an application written in C++ that displays a 12 hour clock and a 24 hour clock side by side. It allows the user to set the time and change it by adding hours, minutes and seconds. 
## What did you do well in this program? What areas could be improved?
I did a good writting the functions to add time to the clock that incorportated error handleing and other function calls to save time. The biggest imporvement that could be done to this program is using a library to make the user menu more appealing. The menu could be changed to a GUI that allows the user to click add hour/minute/second, instead of typing 1,2 or 3.
